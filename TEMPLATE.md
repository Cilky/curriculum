# About Our Template

[Eyebeam's](http://www.eyebeam.org/education) educational focus is to develop artist-led education. This template is intended for our teaching artists to document their lessons with a larger goal to share the curriculum for wider use in classrooms, libraries, after school programs or anywhere STEAM programming can be offered.
