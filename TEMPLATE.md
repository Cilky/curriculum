# About Our Template

Eyebeam's educational focus is to promote artist-led, STEAM based education. This template is intended for our teaching artists to document their lessons with a larger goal for their curriculum to be referenced for wider use in classrooms, libraries, after school programs or anywhere STEAM programming can be offered. 

This template is based off of NYC Department of Education's CS4All Blueprint to teach creative computing. For more information on the core components they advise teachers and classes focus on, to give the students the competency to be better prepared to engage with more difficult STEM lessons, I highly encourage you to read about [their approach here](https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/what-is-cs/)

# TEMPLATE BELOW

## Class Title

## Authors
Your name, please include collaborators or funding institutions that have supported this work

## Essential Question
This is a question that leads to meaningful exploration of CS concepts and practices. Example Computer Science Essential Questions:
- How can computers help us conduct scientific experiments?
- How can programming represent your ideas and beliefs?
- How might we use math to express ourselves creatively?
- How might we use computing to impact our community?
- How might we use computing to help people learn?
- How will computers impact your future?

## Introduction
Please provide a narrative of what the unit is about and why we should learn it that is simple enough that a student could read and understand.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
What age range is this exercise designed for and what do students and teachers need to know or be able to do to be successful? This can be formal or informal. 

### Pacing / Duration
Number of total hours the unit will take in a typical workshop session(s). Please try to take into account transition time between instruction and hands on exercises if any prep is necessary.

- Break down of the class schedule example: 
  - :15 Overview, context, examples and vocabulary 
  - :20 Instruction & hands on exercise 
  - :15 Wrap-up discussion & sharing, reflection or journal and next steps

### Materials
What hardware, software, or other materials will teachers need for lessons and end-of-unit performance task?

## Outcomes & Goals
This section has three parts

#### 1) Provide an overview paragraph that describes briefly the technical concepts and skills covered in the unit;
e.g. "In this three-hour workshop, students will learn about and apply design thinking in the speculative design scenario, then translate their solutions into an interactive 2D single scene game format built in Unity. It includes an introduction to Unity and hands-on coding in Javascript."

#### 2) Vocabulary (example)
* Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs. 
      
#### 3) Prerequisites & Pre-Assessment 
Any coding languages they should already be comfortable with, any frameworks or tools they should have installed before class or any readings and exercises they should complete before class.

## Exercise Descriptions
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. These should be able to be broken out to be taught independently for a shorter class setting or all together for an after school program.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
- Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next leve and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.
- Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
- Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (instagram, tumblr...)? 
- Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what theyâ€™ve learned in some creative way?

## References
Include any sources cited, but not directly linked in the unit.

## Post Session, Implementation Guidance &  Teaching Reflection
e.g. Please provide some guidance based on experience delivering the unit and potential modifications might you are considering making for future iterations of this unit. This is an opportunity for you as the unit author to give teachers practical guidance.
