# Welcome to Eyebeam Open Education

***[Eyebeam](http://www.eyebeam.org) is a nonprofit studio for collaborative experiments with technology toward a more imaginative and just world.***

Eyebeam is working with educators to develop an open source curriculum template so teachers and organizations can easily access workshop ideas for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics) based learning.

We are working open because we believe developing learning materials with the insight and input of a diverse audience will create a better end result. We hope you agree and encourage you to read more about the project and how to get involved!


## Project description

Eyebeam has a 19 year history offering innovative educational programs led by our residents and alumni. The [Eyebeam residency](http://eyebeam.org/residency/) is a prestigious award for artists engaged with technology and technologists working in the arts.  

This project is intended to first provide a template for our teaching artists to document their lessons with a larger goal to share the curriculum for wider use in classrooms, libraries, after school programs or anywhere STEAM programming can be offered. 

Our mission with this project is to:
* Provide free, workshop materials and class exercises 
* Provide a platform for students & teachers to provide feedback and iterate on our curriculum
* Have a consistent location and format for Eyebeamâ€™s education materials

The project will be developed on GitHub so that anyone can contribute resources and feedback as well as provide links to outside tools for easier contribution.


## Get involved

This project benefits from your feedback! 

Experience has shown us that teaching the same class in different environments requires different tactics. Things like class size, duration, available resources and subject familiarity affect how the curriculum is delivered. We want to hear what specific challenges you face - our goal is to provide adaptable and flexible curriculum that will work anywhere.

This curriculum will evolve over time based on our experiences, what we hear from you and new tools and technology that become available. If you would like to get involved, please take a look at our [roadmap](https://github.com/eyebeam/curriculum/issues/1) to see where we are at in our development cycle and how you can contribute. We'd love to [hear your thoughts](https://github.com/eyebeam/curriculum/issues/5).

We are also hosting a session at this year's [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/) (October 27-28, 2017 in London!) where we will discuss and brainstorm what this template should look like.
