# Welcome to Eyebeam Curriculum

***[Eyebeam](http://www.eyebeam.org) is a nonprofit studio for collaborative experiments with technology toward a more imaginative and just world. By providing generous support to artists for research, production and education, Eyebeam makes ideas real.***

Eyebeam is working with teaching artists to develop a lightweight, reusable, open source curriculum template so educators and organizations can easily access curriculum and workshop materials for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and mathmatics) based learning.

We are working open because we believe the insight, input and needs of a diverse audience will enable us to develop better curriculum.

Here you will find information about the project and how to get involved!


## Project description

Eyebeam has a 19 year history offering innovative STEAM educational programming. This project is intended to first provide a template for teaching artists to document their lessons with a larger goal to share the curriculum for wider use in classrooms, libraries, after school programs or anywhere STEAM programming is offered. 


### The project's larger mission is to:

* Provide free, STEAM based workshop materials and exercises 
* Provide a platform for students & teachers to iterate on our curriculum
* Have a consistant location and format for Eyebeamâ€™s education materials

The project will be developed on GitHub so that anyone can contribute resources and feedback as well as provide links to outside tools for easier contribution and feedback.


## Get involved! 

This project will benifit from your feedback! 

Our experience has shown us that teaching the same class in different environments requires different tactics. Things like class size, duration, available resources and subject familiarity all affect how the curriculuim is delivered. We need your feedback on what specific challenges you face - our goal is to provide adaptable and flexible curriculuim that will be able to work in as many situations as possible.

This curriculuim will continuously evolve over time based on our experiences, what we hear from you and new tools and technology that become available. 

We are also hosting a session at this year's [MozFest][https://mozillafestival.org/] (October 27-28, 2017 in London!) where we will discuss and brainstorm what this template should look like.
